### <div align="center">Hi there! I'm Eduardo Leite</div>

I'm a passionate full-stack developer who loves coding. I've worked with a wide range of technologies, from C++ for
microcontrollers to WebRTC for web apps.

Right now, my main tech stack includes React for the website's front-end, Tailwind for the design, and NestJS for the
back-end. I host my projects on Google Cloud, and automate then with CircleCI for a smooth development and deployment
process.
